# gamma_ray_reconstruction_with_ml

Proof of principle application of Graph Neural Networks in the gamma-ray astrophysics community. As a first step, classification of gamma-ray signal from the abundant cosmic-ray background (1/10000, and comparison with previously used CNN-based architectures. The publication on this is here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08674.pdf
The python module here on github is just for demonstration purpose.
